# pyobfuscate
A simple python code obfuscator

To use the script, run the "pyobfuscate.py" file and provide the code that you want to obfuscate in the script. The script will then generate an obfuscated version of the code and export it to a separate script called "obfuscated_code.py".

To execute the obfuscated code, run the "obfuscated_code.py" script.
